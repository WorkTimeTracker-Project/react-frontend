# React Frontend

This repository contains the code for the **frontend** of our project. The application is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and provides a modern, responsive interface for interacting with the backend services.

## Overview

The frontend application focuses on user-friendly interactions for managing employee work sessions. It allows users to:
- View work sessions by employee.
- Filter sessions based on a date range.
- Present data in an intuitive and visually appealing way.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Fetch and display data from the backend in real-time.
- **Date-based Filtering**: Select a date range to narrow down results.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Seamless API Integration**: Communicates efficiently with the backend services.

## Backend

The backend for this project is built with Spring Boot and can be found in the [spring-backend](https://github.com/WorkTimeTracker-Project/Spring-boot-backend) repository. Together, they form a complete system for managing work sessions.
